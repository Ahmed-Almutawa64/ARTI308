# Lab 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Dataset
The Adult Income dataset contains demographic and employment information such as age, education, occupation, and working hours.

## Objective
The purpose of this lab is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to better understand the dataset, identify patterns, and examine relationships between variables before building a machine learning model.

## Dataset Information
- Number of rows: 32,561  
- Number of columns: 15  
- Target variable: income  

## Tasks Performed
- Data loading and inspection  
- Checking missing values and duplicates  
- Descriptive statistics  
- Univariate analysis  
- Bivariate analysis  
- Correlation matrix  

## Conclusion
The dataset is clean and suitable for analysis. Most individuals earn less than 50K, and features such as age and working hours show potential relationships with income.
